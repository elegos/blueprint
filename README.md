# Blueprint

**Blueprint** is a functional flow development environment for Python projects, divided in two main parts: the IDE (GUI) and the runner (script).

The principle is to develop a set of functions and then create different application flows in a graphic interface, in order to focus on the application's logics, rather than on the code itself.

It has been designed with ETL processes in mind, but it can be used with any functional design.

## blueprint-gui

`blueprint-gui` is the graphical user interface written with the Qt6 libraries. It is designed to be run within the virtual environment (if any) of the target project, otherwise it won't be able to scan the available functions.
